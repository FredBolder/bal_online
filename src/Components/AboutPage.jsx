            The first Bal game was programmed by Fred Bolder in Turbo Pascal. Later it was converted by Fred Bolder to C# and 
            many levels and new objects were added. During a webdevelopment course, Fred Bolder made together with Micha≈Ç Kotkowicz, 
            Donnie Avant and Diana Sahlean the web site Games From Scratch including the game Bal. 
            Bal was totally rewritten for JavaScript. The series 1 levels were copied from the C# bal game, but the series 2 levels 
            and the series Small levels were made during the course. The C# bal game has more level series, but they were not copied. 
            Later Fred Bolder decided to make a separate Bal web site based on the Bal code from Games From Scratch, but most of the 
            code had to change a lot, because of the many new objects. There were also a lot of levels added to the existing series.
