            The first Bal game was programmed by Fred Bolder in Turbo Pascal. Later it was converted by Fred Bolder to C# and
            many levels and new objects were added. During a webdevelopment course, Fred Bolder made together with Micha≈Ç Kotkowicz,
            Donnie Avant and Diana Sahlean the web site Games From Scratch including the game Bal.
            Bal was totally rewritten for JavaScript. The series 1 levels were copied from the C# bal game, but the other levels
            were made during the course. The C# bal game has more level series, but they were not copied.
            Later Fred Bolder decided to make a separate Bal web site based on the Bal code from Games From Scratch, but most of the
            code had to change a lot, because of the many new objects and possibilities. There were many new levels added, including
            most levels from the C# bal game.
